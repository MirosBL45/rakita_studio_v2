## Project: Studio Rakita

Shooting events like weddings, sporting events, and high-altitude drone shooting is what Studio Rakita does. I made for them whole web portfolio with Next.js for server-side rendering, using TailwindCSS utility-first CSS styling framework.

### 1. **Framework and Core**

- **Next.js**: Provides the foundation for building a scalable and high-performance React application with server-side rendering and static page generation.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for developing the functionality of the portfolio.

### 2. **Styling**

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a highly customizable and responsive design system for styling the application.

### 3. **Icons and Visuals**

- **React Icons**: A library of popular icons integrated into the project to enhance the visual appeal.
- **React-Countup**: I am using react-countup library to achieve the counter function.
- **Swiper**: I am using Swiper React component which will create required elements for Navigation, Pagination or Scrollbar.

### 4. **Email Services**

- **emailjs**: A library used to send emails directly from the client-side application, enabling easy and efficient email communication.
